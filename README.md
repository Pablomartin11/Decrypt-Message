# Decrypt a message with the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm

[![es](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-es-red.svg)](/README-ES.md)

This is a project for the *Stochastic Processes* subject for the Statistics Degree at University of Valladolid which consists on decrypt an encrypted message adapting the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm for this case leaning on some support functions or files given by the teacher such as the frecuencys of the different word lenghts in the spanish language, bigrams or trigrams, etc.

You can read about the Metropolis-Hasting Algorithm at [Wikipedia-Metropolis-Hastings](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algoritmo_de_Metropolis-Hastings)

Everything is explained with detail in the pdf [project_output](project_output.pdf) and the code itself resides at [project.Rmd](project.Rmd) developed with RMarkdown.
